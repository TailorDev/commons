## About the instructor notes

Each lesson should contain a _Instructor notes_ section, derived from the Software Carpentry lessons, and which is mainly used by the instructors during a workshop. There are a few keywords to identify specific parts of these notes:

- **Action:** something the instructor has to do
- **Question:** a question worth asking the attendees
- **Exercise ideas:** exercises for the attendees
