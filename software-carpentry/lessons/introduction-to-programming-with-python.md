# Introduction to programming with Python

{% hint style='working' %}
You can find the Software Carpentry lesson at: https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/. Nonetheless, we believe this lesson does not target complete beginners to programming. That is why we do not use its content and we have developed our own materials.
