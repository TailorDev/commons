# The UNIX shell

You can find the Software Carpentry lesson at: https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/.

## Introduction

### UNIX?

+ A family of Operating Systems
+ BSD, System V, Linux, MacOS

### The UNIX philosophy

> "the idea that the power of a system comes more<br>from the relationships among programs than from<br>the programs themselves"

..., which means:

+ write programs that do one thing and do it well
+ write programs to work together
+ write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface

### Shell?

* a program that allows to talk to the computer
* powerful, fast, text-based
* ~~not really~~ beautiful
