Since January 2017, **TailorDev Commons** is the charity part of [TailorDev](https://tailordev.fr/), dedicated to **knowledge sharing** and the **promotion of the Open Science initiative**. Those two major aspects will be tackled by organising [workshops](/software-carpentry/past-workshops.md) around the digital researcher's toolbox (versioning systems, programming languages, etc.) and [speaking](/conferences/past-talks.md) in research entities. If you are interested, please contact us: [commons@tailordev.fr](mailto:common@tailordev.fr).

We are committed to performing just like if it would have been a paid contract: same energy, same motivation and same "professionalism"!

For more information about our motivations behind this initiative, you can read the announcement blog post on the TailorDev website: https://tailordev.fr/blog/2017/02/15/tailordev-commons/.
